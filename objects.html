    /* Object is a type of value which can group multiple values.
    Actually you've learned this before, check your C++ book. We've learned this in with "Class" concept, but in here
    it's a bit different, there's no class in JS, and "Object" act as bit like class in JS, but not completely, but it's the same concept. And object is a thing which comes with OOP.
    Actually Object is the same concept as Structer/struct in C (for more info check the C language folder). In struct we create struct with a
    name and inside we create and group some variables or objects. This is for to avoid repetition. if we create something like that we can use it
    several times. for eg: 
    if we're going to store the name and age of students in a university we can create two objects as "name" and "age" inside a variable and 
    use them several times and we just have to create the object just one time, that's the benefit.*/

    // * if we check the data type of variable product it'll show as object.

    // this how to create object :-
    const product = {
      // the values on the left are called property, and we use them to access the values:
      name : 'socks',
      price : 1090
    };

    console.log(product);
    console.log(product.name);
    console.log(product.price);

    // this is how we access and change the value of a object :
    product.name = 'kidney';
    console.log(product.name);

    // and we can create a new object/property to the variabel by :-
    product.newProperty = true;
    console.log(product.newProperty);

    // we can delete a object/property just by using "delete" keyword :-
    delete product.newProperty;
    console.log(product);


    // there's another way to access or to create a property rather than Dot notation, which is bracket notation.

    const product2 =  {
      name : 'shirt',
      ['delivery-time'] : '1 day'
    };

    console.log(product2);
    console.log(product2['delivery-time']);

    /* so what's the difference, well in bracket notation you can use dash "-" on property name, and in the case of Dot notation it's not
    possibe, it'll get you an error.
    simply, Bracket notation lets us use properties that don't work with dot notation. 
    Another features: 
    * you can use a variable instead of just a name inside [' '].
    * and you can also use calculation like:
      product2['delivery' + 'time'].*/
  
      /* which one should we use ?
      -use dot notation by default 
      -for properties that don't work, use bracket notation */
  
  
  
      const product3 =  {
      name : 'shirt',
      'delivery-time' : '1 day',

      rating: {               //we can also create an object inside an object for organization, which is called Nested object.
        stars: 4.5,
        count: 87
      },

      addition: function sum()      // we can also create an function inside a object which is called a Method. There's more about method in C++ book. And function is also a value. 
      {
        console.log( 3 + 4);
      }
    };
  
    // just a showcase of accessing the inner object.
    console.log(product3.rating.stars);

    // just a showcase of accessing the function. and console.log() is also a function created inside the "console" object by Js.
    // so "console.log()" and "Math.random()" is just two Methods.
    product3.addition();



    /* so "console.log()" is a Built-in Object by Js and there's two more:

    * JSON
    * localStorage
    
    

      JSON(javaScript Object Notation):
      so it's a syntax similar to JS Object but with less features.
      so we can also create a Object using JSON, but you can't include any methods/functions
      and all property and strings should be in double quotes ("").
      JSON won't support single quotes('').
      So why should we use JSON instead of normal JS Object ?
      1) coz JS Object only make sense in JS.
      2) but JSON can be understood almost by all programming languages.
      So JSON is more Universal.
      And JSON is more useful when we send data b/w computers which might use different programming languages.
      And we also use JSON when we store data.


      So there's a built-in JSON object which will help us
      to convert JS object to JSON and vice versa.
    */

    // to convert from JS to JSON:
    JSON.stringify(product3);   // remember JSON.stringify() is a built-in JSON method inside the object, it's not a JSON. And that's why we can use a function/method in here.

    console.log(JSON.stringify(product3));

    const heh = JSON.stringify(product3);

    // to convert from JSON to JS:
    JSON.parse(heh);
    
    console.log(JSON.parse(heh));



    /*
    Local storage:
    it's the secondary storage in our computer. Local storage help us to
    save values more permanently. The variables are temporary, the values
    will get lost when we refresh the page.

    to save values:
    localStorage.setItem('name', 'value');      this is the syntax. 
    
    And remember localStorage only support strings.

    to get back the value:
    localStorage.getItem('name');
    */


    // More info: 

    /*
    Auto-Boxing:
    values can also have properties and methods. Like string, numbers etc...

    const a = 'hello'.length;       //this is a property.
    console.log(a);

    so what happens here is that Js will automatically wraps the string value 'hello' into a special object which is called Auto-Boxing, and the object will've a 
    nbr of properties which will help us to do something on the string value. I'd like to think this properties as functions coz it's doing a function.
    Another one is :-

    const b = 'hello'.toUpperCase();    //this is a method.
    console.log(b);
