  //  in js we use "let" to create a variable, and the compiler will analayse the data type from the value we assign.
    let a = 5;
    console.log(a + 8 + 56);

    let calculations = 2 + 2;
    console.log(calculations);

    let result = calculations + a;
    console.log(result);

    let message = "helllllooooooo";
    console.log(message), console.log(result);


    // there are 3 ways to create a variable
    /*
    1) let

    2) const
      const a = 5;  you can't change the value later coz it's constant.
      
    3) var a = 3;  
      this is the original way to create a var and there isn't much difference
      b/w let and var except var have some issues and developers don't use it anymore, you can find var on older js codes.
      let is most used one nowadays.  */



      // to find out the type of a variable we can use "typeof"
      console.log(typeof message);
