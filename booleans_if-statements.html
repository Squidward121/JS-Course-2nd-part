    // boolean values:
    true;
    false;

    console.log(5 === '5');
    console.log(3 > 5 - 5);
  /* it's better to use 5 === 5 (triple equal to) rather than 5 == 5 (double equal to),
  coz double equal to converts both operands to same data type which is not good in some situations.
  And triple equal to will always keep the operands data type original which is always good coz we want accurate answers always.
  
  * And it's the same in not equal to :  !==   instead of !=   .
  
  * comparison operators have the lower priority than math operators.
  
  * logical operator have less priority than both comparison and math operators.*/


  if (true) 
  {
    console.log('helllooooooooooooo');
  }

  /* if the given condition inside the bracket is true or the keyword 'true', the given code below will run.
  and if the given condition inside the bracket is false or the keyword 'false', the given code below will not run. */

  // now let's write a code to check someone is old enough to drive :

  let age = 24;
  if ( age >= 18 )
  {
    console.log('you are legally allowed to drive');
  }
  else
  {
    console.log('you are legally not allowed to drive');
  }


  /*
  falsy values:
  
  * false
  * 0
  * ' '
  * NaN   (Not a Number)
  * undefined
  * null
  
  
  truthy values: 
  
  Any values that aren't false values is truthy values
  
  
  you can use falsy and truthy values for if statements, logical, comparisonal or any conditions instead of true value and false value....
  it works as shortcuts
  */

  
  /*
  shortcuts for if-statements:

  1) ternary operator ?:
    true ? 'truthy' : 'falsy';

    true = condition
    'truthy' = code to be executed if the condition is true.
    'falsy' = code to be executed if the condition is false.

    And we can save the result directly to a variable like :-
    
    let result = true ? 'truthy' : 'falsy';
    
    this will store the code or value to be executed if the condition is true or false directly to result.



  2) guard operator &&
    
    false && console.log('hello');
    The compiler will stop early coz && oparator need both sides to be true, so it's not mandotary to check the other condition.

    this is a shortcut for this :
    if(condition) 
    {
      console.log('hello');
    }

  3) defualt operator ||
    
    it's the same as guard operator, but starts with truthy.
    truth || console.log('hello');

    this is a shortcut for : 
    
    let currency;

    if (!condition) 
    {
      currency = 'USD';
    }
